# dPL run track record

Structure (2026-07-15 reorg): **canonical** runs live directly under
`artifacts/dpl/<label>` — one per methods stage, each with
`checkpoints/best.pt`, `train_log.csv`, `params_dpl.csv`, `metrics_<label>.csv`.
Everything exploratory/superseded lives in `testing/` under its **original**
name (kept so memory/session logs cross-reference cleanly). `fidelity/` is the
numerics benchmark (infrastructure, not a run); `hybrid/` is the SAC×LSTM
track with its own lineage. All skill numbers are pooled 15-basin mean KGE,
frozen-model scoring (numba; PT via `sacsma.pet_pt`) unless marked
*(torch)* — Noah runs are torch-only (no frozen Noah physics).

Standing methods shared by every canonical grid run: `physical` feature
variant, pooled 15cdec training (daily gage FNF, cal WY1989–2003 / val
WY2004–2018), CalSim3-footprint aggregation (`--calsim-footprint`), NNSE+log
loss + variance-matching term, cal-KGE selection every 2 epochs, truncated
no-grad spinup from 1978-10-01.

## Canonical lineage

| label | domain | delta vs predecessor | cal/val KGE |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hamon_dense` | 15cdec (7891 HRU) | — (the original dPL) | 0.810/0.840 recorded — **artifacts lost, retrain queued** |
| `hamon` | 15cdec_grid (2074 cells) | native-grid retrain + CalSim3 footprint | 0.807/0.829 |
| `pt` | 15cdec_grid | Priestley–Taylor PET (Bristow–Campbell Rn) for the SAC ET cascade | 0.791/0.823 |
| `pt_refined` | 15cdec_grid | + snow-cover albedo (0.6) + arid dewpoint depression (2 °C) | 0.799/0.826 |
| `noah_lite` | 15cdec_grid | Noah-lite canopy ET (1 learned DOF `soil_chi`) on PT potential | ~0.759 cal *(torch)* — params export TODO |
| `pt_refined_ft` | 15cdec_grid | (PENDING — active run) fine-tune from `pt_refined` + ET/SWE obs losses + seasonal Kpet + P−Q level anchor | running; sel 0.8022@ep10 |

## Track record (chronological)

### Feature/loss ablation — 15cdec fine-HRU domain, Hamon (2026-07-10/11)
- **`static`** — one-hot soil/veg statics, MSE. First working arm; proved the
  GA-prior init + bounded-sigmoid parameter net trains.
- **`static_nnse`** — NNSE loss. Better than MSE on the pooled objective →
  became the default.
- **`static_widebounds`** — widened parameter bounds. No win; GA bounds kept.
- **`static_adaptreg`** — Rahman-ALF adaptive per-basin weights. No win at
  the pooled optimum; off by default.
- **`climate_grouped`** — climate-statistics features + per-physics-group
  heads. Beaten by `physical`.
- **`physical`** (→ slot `hamon_dense`; artifacts LOST 2026-07-15, see its
  README) — continuous soil/veg/terrain/LAI features. **Winner: val 0.840**
  (vs levers 0.836, smooth 0.838). Plain features beat every regularization
  lever. NHG (+23% bias) / FOL (α-damping) = structural ceiling.
- **`physical_levers`** — physical + spatial-reg/adaptive levers: 0.836,
  a wash. Its params/metrics remain the hybrid track's physics defaults.
- **`physical_smooth`** — learned spatial smoother (gnn): 0.838, a wash.
- **`physical_seasonal`** — day-of-year harmonics on Kpet+recessions:
  seasonal recessions HURT; only seasonal Kpet helped (weakly).
- **`seasonal_kpet`** — seasonal Kpet, unbounded coeffs: diverged at lr 1e-3.
- **`seasonal_kpet_bounded`** — tanh-capped (±0.18): stable, a wash under
  flow-only training (foreshadowing: the DOF is unidentifiable from flow —
  see the 2026-07-15 obs-loss series where it becomes the key lever).

### Domain / footprint (2026-07-11/13)
- **`physical_grid`** — retrain on the native 1/16° grid (2074 cells, full
  footprint): val 0.834, −0.006 vs fine-HRU. Coarse grid recovers ~99% of
  skill; the residual is the lost orographic HRU-meteo downscaling (upstream
  CADWR product, not in repo).
- **`physical_grid_calsim`** (→ **`hamon`**) — CalSim3-footprint re-foot of
  11/15 basins (coarse grid over-reaches the true catchments +9–66%):
  skill-neutral (0.807/0.829), re-footed pbias better, YRS/MIL casualties.
  Footprint became standing method; recalibration folded in.
- **`hamon_grid_dynkpet`** — climate-state (wetness-index) dynamic Kpet.
  Stopped moot when the program pivoted to PT physics.

### Noah ET line (2026-07-12)
Diagnosis that launched it: Noah's deficit vs Hamon is a LEVEL deficit
present in calibration (flat cal→val), i.e. parameter identifiability — not
regime-shift extrapolation. Streamflow alone cannot identify a 7-param ET.
- **`noah_grid`** (v1) — full Jarvis canopy ET, uniform init: hurt dry
  basins (opposite-bias ET pattern, over-LAI 3.25 vs obs 1.3).
- **`noah_grid_v2`** — pinned observed veg_frac + seasonal LAI; 6 physiology
  params on a separate trunk.
- **`noah_grid_v3`** — best full Noah: **val 0.760** vs Hamon 0.834. The gap
  concentrated in 4 basins (NHG/SCC/TRM/BND = 55%).
- **`noah_grid_v4`–`v6`** — physics refinements: re-shuffled which basins
  fit, never closed the level gap (v5/v6: PT potential caused an SCC volume
  blowup).
- **`noah_lite_hamon`** — the minimal identifiable rebuild
  (AET = β(SM)^χ·PET, ONE learned DOF): the honest ablation floor on Hamon
  potential.
- **`noah_lite_pt`** — lite + PT potential (lifts the Kpet×Hamon ET ceiling).
- **`noah_lite_pt_calsim`** (→ **`noah_lite`**) — + CalSim3 footprint; the
  canonical Noah. ~0.759 cal *(torch)*. 1 DOF ≈ 7 DOF (v3) — confirming the
  non-identifiability diagnosis. Base model for the ET-obs screening.
- **`noah_lite_pt_calsim_et05`** — v1 ET obs loss (raw monthly central pull,
  λ=0.5, σ-floor 0.2): **degraded flow** 0.675→0.567 (baseline 0.759).
  Finding: the per-month pull pins LEVEL (products disagree 38–85%) as hard
  as PHASE (agree ~0.5 mo). Led to the v2 shape/level/SWE decomposition.

### Priestley–Taylor plain-SAC line (2026-07-13/14)
Rationale: energy-based PET for warming robustness (Wi et al. 2024) without
Noah's identifiability problem — PT drives the FROZEN SAC ET cascade.
- **`physical_pt_calsim`** (→ **`pt`**) — plain PT: 0.791/0.823. PT's summer
  +27% ET vs Hamon; Kpet re-optimizes level, cannot reshape season.
- **`physical_pt_calsim_refined`** (→ **`pt_refined`**) — + snow-cover albedo
  (PET collapses under the model's own Snow-17 pack) + arid dewpoint
  depression (both one-directional, Kpet-unabsorbable shape corrections):
  **0.799/0.826**, sel 0.7954@ep42. The baseline/donor for the obs work.
  Hamon reference on the same footing: 0.807/0.829.

### ET/SWE observation series — on `pt_refined` (2026-07-14/15)
Loss design v2.1: ET seasonal-SHAPE pull (level-blind, 1-ensemble-σ deadband,
Huber k=3) + ET level envelope + SWE shape pull (4 products, snow basins
auto-masked), λ=0.2 each, cal-window only, never a selection metric.
- **`physical_pt_refined_et_diverged`** — v2 as-built: NaN divergence
  (f32 backward overflow through the 366-day recurrence → inf×0 at a branch
  gate). Fix: Huber on both obs losses.
- **`physical_pt_refined_et_huber_nodeadband`** — Huber alone: identical
  peak-then-decay (0.748@ep12) — objective conflict burning the shared
  grad-clip budget. Fix: the deadband (zero force within product spread).
- **`physical_pt_refined_et`** — deadband+Huber, +ET only: 0.766/0.797.
  ET-shape RMS ~halved domain-wide (except NHG/ISB, worse).
- **`physical_pt_refined_etswe`** — +SWE: 0.767/0.811. **SWE strictly
  dominates +ET** (regularizer; peak month already matched at baseline).
  Key diagnosis: the "level-blind" shape pull LEAKS level ±100 mm/yr through
  the storage nonlinearity — that leak IS the flow cost. Water-balance
  closure check: P−Q closes at all 15 basins; the product bracket spans up
  to 72% of Q in arid basins (products cannot inform level; flow pins it
  ~10× tighter) — products = SHAPE only.
- **`physical_pt_refined_etswe_skpet`** — + seasonal Kpet (joint, from
  scratch): fast peak sel 0.767@ep8 (frozen 0.771/0.808, **|val pbias| 6.1
  vs 9.0 baseline** — seasonal ET timing fixes volume bias static Kpet
  can't), then Adam-vs-tanh saturation instability (all loss terms worse
  ep8→ep14, harmonics pinned at the ±0.25 joint cap, annual ET drifting
  10–17% inside the product bracket). Stopped ep14. Casualties NHG/TRM/YRS.
- **`physical_pt_refined_etswe_skpet_ft`** (→ **`pt_refined_ft`** on
  promotion) — ACTIVE: warm-start from `pt_refined` best.pt (`--init-from`,
  exact-equivalence verified), lr 2e-4, same obs λs, seasonal Kpet, and the
  level hinge re-targeted to the WATER-BALANCE anchor P−Q_obs ±15%
  (`--et-anchor-band`; replaces the too-wide product envelope; no
  basin-specific masking anywhere). ep0 sel = donor's 0.7954 exactly;
  0.8022@ep10 and climbing — first run in the program above 0.80.

## Open items
- `hamon_dense` retrain (fine-HRU, Hamon, full footprint, current defaults)
  — queued behind the active GPU run.
- `noah_lite` has no params export (torch-only path) — run
  `sacsma dpl evaluate noah_lite/checkpoints/best.pt` when the GPU frees.
- `hamon` params_dpl.csv regen in flight (evaluate now defaults output to
  the checkpoint's run dir — the old `artifacts/dpl/<variant>` default is
  what destroyed `physical`'s derived outputs).
- `pt_refined_ft`: on success, move the run dir + `skpet_ft_train.log` in as
  `pt_refined_ft/` and update the lineage table with frozen numbers.
